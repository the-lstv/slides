<!-- Every root div in this file is added as a slide. They can have an ID, which becomes the slide ID. -->
<!-- Styles and scripts can be added here as usuall. A <head> element is supported as well, which will extend the template's head (to some degree). -->

        Here I host various presentations I made mostly for school with my own presentation framework.
        It's quite simple thanks to my backend and frontend frameworks (Akeno and LS). Each presentation is just a simple HTML file that includes the template.<br>
        It directly supports *markdown* and animations & transitions are basically free. It's probably the most flexible way to make presentations if you are a developer :) <br>
