        Here I host various presentations I made mostly for school with my own presentation framework.
        It's quite simple thanks to my backend and frontend frameworks (Akeno and LS). Each presentation is just a simple HTML file that includes the template.<br>
        It directly supports *markdown* and animations & transitions are basically free. It's the most flexible way to make presentations if you are a developer :) <br>

        height: 100%;
